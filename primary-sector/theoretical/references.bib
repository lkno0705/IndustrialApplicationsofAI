	abstract = {For most developing countries, agriculture is their primary source of revenue. Modern agriculture is a constantly growing approach for agricultural advances and farming techniques. It becomes challenging for the farmers to satisfy our planet’s evolving requirements and the expectations of merchants, customers, etc. Some of the challenges the farmers face are-(i) Dealing with climatic changes because of soil erosion and industry emissions (ii) Nutrient deficiency in the soil, caused by a shortage of crucial minerals such as potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus can result in reduced crop growth. (iii) Farmers make a mistake by cultivating the same crops year after year without experimenting with different varieties. They add fertilizers randomly without understanding the inferior quality or quantity. The paper aims to discover the best model for crop prediction, which can help farmers decide the type of crop to grow based on the climatic conditions and nutrients present in the soil. This paper compares popular algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier using two different criterions Gini and Entropy. Results reveal that Random Forest gives the highest accuracy among the three.},

	abstract = {India being an agriculture country, its economy predominantly depends on agriculture yield growth and agroindustry products. Data Mining is an emerging research field in crop yield analysis. Yield prediction is a very important issue in agricultural. Any farmer is interested in knowing how much yield he is about to expect and what is the crop that is suitable for the land. Analyze the various related attributes like location, pH value from which alkalinity of the soil is determined. Along with it, percentage of nutrients like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) Location is used along with the use of third-party applications like APIs for weather and temperature, type of soil, nutrient value of the soil in that region, amount of rainfall in the region, soil composition can be determined. All these attributes of data will be analyzed, train the data with various suitable machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, KNN and voting classifier for creating a model. The system comes with a model to be precise and accurate in predicting crop yield and deliver the end user with the proper recommendations about required fertilizer ratio based on atmospheric and soil parameters of the land which enhance to increase the crop yield and increase farmer revenue. Thus, the proposed system takes the data regarding the quality of soil and the weather-related information as an input. The quality of the soil such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and Ph value. Weather related information like Rainfall, Temperature and Humidity to predict the better crop. In our project we are taking the datasets from Kaggle website.},

	abstract = {To meet global food requirements while responding to the environmental challenges of the 21st century, an agri-environmental transition towards sustainable agricultural practices is necessary. Crop rotation is an ancestral practice and is a pillar of sustainable agriculture. However, this practice requires more organization on the part of producers for the management of crop inputs. That is why the development of a methodology for forecasting crop rotations in the medium term and at the field level is necessary. However, to date, only a methodology based on the Seq2Seq-LSTM has been theorized without being tested on a concrete case of application. The objective of this article is therefore to evaluate the performance of a Seq2Seq-LSTM methodology to predict crop rotations on a real case. The methodology was applied to a problem of crop rotation prediction for field crop farms in Québec, Canada. Using the Recall(N) metric and a historical sequence of length 6, the next 3 crops grown in a field can be predicted with over 81\% success when considering 10 selected options. In addition, the methodology was augmented with contextual information such as economic and meteorological data to refine the forecasts. This augmentation systematically improves the performance of the model. This observation provides a relevant line of research for identifying other factors that influence producers’ decision-making on crop rotation.},

This means it is necessary to limit the environmental impact of agricultural activities on soil and water and to be mindful of the carbon footprint, while maintaining crop yields and economic benefits for producers. Crop rotation is a valuable tool in sustainable agriculture, but this technique has to be appropriately coupled with sustainable fertilization plans to optimize crops. The proposed methodology uses recurrent neural networks (RNN); more precisely, LSTMs, in a Seq2Seq architecture, to predict the most probable scenarios of crop rotations to be exploited in a field in subsequent growing seasons, according to cropping habits. The output can be used in crop models to build a decision support system for greater sustainability in agricultural production by allowing producers to choose the strategy that offers the best compromise between profitability and environmental impact.},

	abstract = {Cropping decisions affect the nature, timing and intensity of agricultural management strategies. Specific crop rotations are associated with different environmental impacts, which can be beneficial or detrimental. The ability to map, characterise and accurately predict rotations enables targeting of mitigation measures where most needed and forecasting of potential environmental risks. Using six years of the national UKCEH Land Cover® plus: Crops maps (2015–2020), we extracted crop sequences for every agricultural field parcel in Great Britain (GB). Our aims were to first characterise spatial patterns in rotation properties over a national scale based on their length, type and structural diversity values, second, to test an approach to predicting the next crop in a rotation, using transition probability matrices, and third, to test these predictions at a range of spatial scales. Strict cyclical rotations only occupy 16 \% of all agricultural land, whereas long-term grassland and complex-rotational agriculture each occupy over 40 \%. Our rotation classifications display a variety of distinctive spatial patterns among rotation lengths, types and diversity values. Rotations are mostly 5 years in length, short mixed crops are the most abundant rotation type, and high structural diversity is concentrated in east Scotland. Predictions were most accurate when using the most local spatial approach (spatial scaling), 5-year rotations, and including long-term grassland. The prediction framework we built demonstrates that our crop predictions have an accuracy of 36–89 \%, equivalent to classification accuracy of national crop and land cover mapping using earth observation, and we suggest this could be improved with additional contextual data. Our results emphasise that rotation complexity is multi-faceted, yet it can be mapped in different ways and forms the basis for further exploration in and beyond agronomy, ecology, and other disciplines.},

	abstract = {Farmers must yearly allocate fields to different crops and choose crop management options. Far from being obvious, these decisions are critical because they modify farm productivity and profitability in the short and long run. To support farmers and efficiently allocate scarce resources, decision support models are developed. Decision support models are mainly based on two concepts, the cropping plan and the crop rotation decisions. These decisions concern crop choice, crop spatial distribution within the farmland and crop temporal successions over years. Decisions are at the core of the farm management. Decisions have strong impacts on resource use efficiency and on environmental processes at both farm and landscape scales. We review here more than 120 references where cropping plan and crop rotation decision concepts were incorporated into models. Our aim is to review how these two concepts have been formalised and used in agronomic, economic and land-use studies. We found that cropping plan decisions selection and design have been done using many approaches based on different objectives and handled at very different scales. The main results show that (1) cropping plan design decisions have mainly been tackled as a static concept, i.e. as if they were a single decision made only once a year or once a rotation; (2) modelling the achievement of a suitable cropping plan is often based on a single monetary criterion optimization procedure instead of a multi-criteria assessment; and (3) when considered, uncertainty of information is defined as stochastic factors or probability of occurrence, but this probability is kept static whatever the knowledge of the dynamic evolution of various constraints. We argue that cropping plan and crop rotation decisions are on the contrary dynamic processes incorporated into a succession of other planned and adaptive decisions made at annual and long-term horizons. For supporting farmers in their decisions, new cropping plan decision models will require new modelling paradigm. A promising improvement could be reached by including explicitly the simulation of the farmers' decision-making processes, based on the simulation of the decision-making processes rather than on single normative approaches.},
