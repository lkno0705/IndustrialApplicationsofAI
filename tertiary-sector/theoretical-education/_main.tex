    \section{Introduction}
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made significant inroads into the education landscape, promising enhanced learning experiences, improved efficiency, and personalized educational pathways. As the deployment and research of AI technologies in education continues to gather momentum, it is essential to acknowledge that the impact of these systems extends far beyond their immediate advantages and drawbacks \cite{chen_ai_2023}. Engaging in a meaningful and informed discourse about AI in education is imperative to ensure the fair and responsible implementation and development of AI systems in an education setting. In addition, a survey of the Pew Research Center revealed, that a growing share of people are concerned about the development and deployment of AI systems. This includes the fear of potential job loss, privacy concerns and the loss of human connection \cite{nadeem_1_2022}. In this work, Opportunities and Risks are shown based on current state-of-the-art AI systems while addressing, widespread concerns, as well as showing potential problems which should be addressed in the current rapid development of such systems.
