	abstract = {Die Studie dokumentiert den Stand der Digitalisierung im Schulsystem aus der Perspektive von Lehrkräften. Grundlage bildet eine bundesweit repräsentative Befragung von 2.750 Lehrkräften an Gesamtschulen, Gymnasien und vergleichbaren Schulen der Sekundarstufe I und II in Deutschland. Die Lehrkräfte beschreiben ihre Nutzung digitaler Medien und Techniken und die Rahmenbedingungen an ihrer Schule – wobei ein Vergleich des Standes Februar 2021 mit der Situation vor der Corona‐Pandemie 2020 gezogen wird. Erhoben wird auf dieser Basis auch die Selbsteinschätzung zu ihren digitalen Kompetenzen, die Arbeitszeit und Arbeitsbelastung sowie das Ausmaß des digitalen Stresses. Die Studie präsentiert die Ergebnisse und vergleicht sie mit früheren, nationalen und internationalen Studienergebnissen. Anhand von differenzierten Analysen kommt sie zu vier zentralen Befunden: Erstens hat 2020/2021 eine forcierte Digitalisierung an deutschen Schulen stattgefunden, die sehr stark durch technische ad‐hoc‐Lösungen zur Sicherung des Fernlernens und Wechselunterrichts und andere Basis‐Lösungen geprägt ist – aber kaum durch eine weiterführende Praxis des digitalen Lehrens und Lernens. Zweitens hat dies die Arbeitsbedingungen (Arbeitszeit, Arbeitsbelastung, Technostress) für Lehrkräfte in der Krisensituation sehr deutlich verändert. Drittens sind die digitalen Kompetenzen sehr unterschiedlich ausgeprägt, viele Lehrkräfte stehen vor großen Herausforderungen. Neben der organisierten Weiterbildung spielen entwicklungsförderliche Rahmenbedingungen an den Schulen für die Kompetenzentwicklung eine zentrale Rolle. Viertens existiert eine digitale Spaltung zwischen den Schulen in Deutschland, die erhebliche Unterschiede in der Arbeitssituation und den beruflichen Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten von Lehrkräften bedingt – aber auch für die Bildungschancen der Schülerinnen und Schüler ein Problem darstellt.},

Thus, it is important for those in product development, research, and public policy to understand how the public’s perception of AI is shaped. In this study, we conducted focus groups and an online survey to determine the knowledge of AI held by the American public, and to judge whether entertainment media is a major influence on how Americans perceive AI. What we found is that the American public’s knowledge of AI is patchy: some have a good understanding of what is and what is not AI, but many do not. When it came to understanding what AI can do, most respondents believe that AI could “replace human jobs” but few thought that it could “feel emotion.” Most respondents were optimistic about the future and impact of AI, though about one third were not sure. Most respondents also did not think they could develop an emotional bond with or be comfortable being provided care by an AI. Regarding the influence of entertainment media on perceptions of AI, we found a significant relationship (p {\textless} 0.5) between people’s beliefs about AI in entertainment media and their beliefs about AI in reality. Those who believe AI is realistically depicted in entertainment media were more likely to see AIs as potential emotional partners or apocalyptic robots than to imagine AIs taking over jobs or operating as surveillance tools.},

Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.},

It pointed out the need for selecting the right technology tools for the children with learning disabilities, to enable achievement of the target goals, and highlighted instructional guides for the classroom teachers, that would make children with learning disabilities benefit maximally from the use of assistive technology tools, whether in the classroom or at home, in order that the technology would make the teaching-learning process enjoyable and productive. The possible challenges faced by developing nations in using assistive technology were mentioned. It concluded that there was potential for assistive technology to improve the lives and to eliminate learning difficulties for children with learning disabilities.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the development of teamwork skills in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises organise their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimised. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin’s role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student’s predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17680},
	abstract = {Recent research has focused on using large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for hate speech through fine-tuning or prompting. Despite the growing interest in this area, these generated explanations' effectiveness and potential limitations remain poorly understood. A key concern is that these explanations, generated by LLMs, may lead to erroneous judgments about the nature of flagged content by both users and content moderators. For instance, an LLM-generated explanation might inaccurately convince a content moderator that a benign piece of content is hateful. In light of this, we propose an analytical framework for examining hate speech explanations and conducted an extensive survey on evaluating such explanations. Specifically, we prompted GPT-3 to generate explanations for both hateful and non-hateful content, and a survey was conducted with 2,400 unique respondents to evaluate the generated explanations. Our findings reveal that (1) human evaluators rated the GPT-generated explanations as high quality in terms of linguistic fluency, informativeness, persuasiveness, and logical soundness, (2) the persuasive nature of these explanations, however, varied depending on the prompting strategy employed, and (3) this persuasiveness may result in incorrect judgments about the hatefulness of the content. Our study underscores the need for caution in applying LLM-generated explanations for content moderation. Code and results are available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/GPT3-HateEval.},
