	abstract = {Advancements in technology have made deep learning a hot research area, and we see its applications in various fields. Its widespread use in silicon wafer defect recognition is replacing traditional machine learning and image processing methods of defect monitoring. This article presents a review of the deep learning methods employed for wafer map defect recognition. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted to determine how the semiconductor industry is leveraged by deep learning research advancements for wafer defects recognition and analysis. Forty-four articles from well-known databases have been selected for this review. The articlesâ€™ detailed study identified the prominent deep learning algorithms and network architectures for wafer map defect classification, clustering, feature extraction, and data synthesis. The identified learning algorithms are grouped as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and hybrid learning. The network architectures include different forms of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Auto-encoder (AE). Various issues of multi-class and multi-label defects have been addressed, solving data unavailability, class imbalance, instance labeling, and unknown defects. For future directions, it is recommended to invest more efforts in the accuracy of the data generation procedures and the defect pattern recognition frameworks for defect monitoring in real industrial environments.},

	abstract = {Advanced data analysis tools and techniques are important for semiconductor companies to gain competitive advantage. In particular, yield prediction tools, which fully utilize production data, help to improve operational efficiency and reduce production costs. This paper introduces a novel and scalable framework for semiconductor manufacturing Final Test (FT) yield prediction leveraging machine learning techniques. This framework is able to predict FT yield at wafer fabrication stage, so that FT low yield problems can be caught at an earlier production stage compared to past studies. Our work presents a robust solution to automatically handle both numerical and categorical production related data without prior knowledge of the low yield root cause. Gaussian Mixture Models, One Hot Encoder and Label Encoder techniques are adopted for data pre-processing. To improve model performance for both binary and multi-class classification, model selection and model ensemble using the F1-macro method is demonstrated. The framework has been applied to three mass production products with different wafer technologies and manufacturing flows. All of them achieved high F1-macro test score indicative of the robustness of our framework.},

	abstract = {Since semiconductor manufacturing consists of hundreds of processes, a faulty wafer detection system, which allows for earlier detection of faulty wafers, is required. statistical process control (SPC) and virtual metrology (VM) have been used to detect faulty wafers. However, there are some limitations in that SPC requires linear, unimodal and single variable data and VM underestimates the deviations of predictors. In this paper, seven different machine learning-based novelty detection methods were employed to detect faulty wafers. The models were trained with Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) data to detect wafers having faulty metrology values. The real world semiconductor manufacturing data collected from a semiconductor fab were tested. Since the real world data have more than 150 input variables, we employed three different dimensionality reduction methods. The experimental results showed a high True Positive Rate (TPR). These results are promising enough to warrant further study.},

	abstract = {Virtual metrology (VM) is a promising solution for wafer-to-wafer quality monitoring in the semiconductor manufacturing process. VM alternates physical metrology with a prediction model trained using previous metrology data. Active learning can be used to build a VM model for new equipment efficiently with reduced metrology costs. However, conventional active learning is limited by a low prediction accuracy at its initial stage, which is referred to as the cold-start problem. In this study, we propose a domain-adaptive active learning method to address this issue. Using existing equipment as the source domain, the proposed method initializes the VM model through unsupervised domain adaptation from the source domain to the target domain. Active learning is then performed to iteratively update the VM model toward improving the prediction accuracy. Thus, the metrology cost required to obtain a VM model that satisfies the desired prediction accuracy for the target metrology task can be reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally using real-world data from a semiconductor manufacturer.},

	abstract = {It has been recognized that effective fault detection techniques can help semiconductor manufacturers reduce scrap, increase equipment uptime, and reduce the usage of test wafers. Traditional univariate statistical process control charts have long been used for fault detection. Recently, multivariate statistical fault detection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods have drawn increasing interest in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, such as nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to product mix, and process steps with variable durations, have posed some difficulties to the PCA-based methods. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, a fault detection method using the k-nearest neighbor rule (FD-kNN) is developed in this paper. Because in fault detection faults are usually not identified and characterized beforehand, in this paper the traditional kNN algorithm is adapted such that only normal operation data is needed. Because the developed method makes use of the kNN rule, which is a nonlinear classifier, it naturally handles possible nonlinearity in the data. Also, because the FD-kNN method makes decisions based on small local neighborhoods of similar batches, it is well suited for multimodal cases. Another feature of the proposed FD-kNN method, which is essential for online fault detection, is that the data preprocessing is performed automatically without human intervention. These capabilities of the developed FD-kNN method are demonstrated by simulated illustrative examples as well as an industrial example.},
